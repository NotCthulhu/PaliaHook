#Soft-Hack
This repository contains a work-in-progress soft-hack for Palia, currently featuring functionalities such as ESP for Mineables and Creatures. 
Currently compatible with Palia version 0.166.2.

**Compatibility**: The hack is compatible with both DX11 and DX12 using the same DLL. To access configuration overlay, press F12.

Initially, this project aimed to provide utilities like ESP, NPC finder, auto-walk to waypoints, multi-stack crafting, and automatic furnace filling. However, as I've finished all the available content in the game I no longer have a need to develop this library further, so I'm open-sourcing it for others to build their stuff uppon.

**Dependencies** (included):
- ImGUI
- GLEW
- Detours

Additional Notes:
The SDK was extracted using a customized version of **Dumper-7**.

The RendererHook is a modified version of a project sourced from the internet years ago, so I'm unable to provide proper attribution.
